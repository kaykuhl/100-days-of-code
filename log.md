# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent 1 hour on working on a tutorial/workshop where I am building an application using the Mars Rover API (my first time building something in Java). The link to the course is here: https://proffesso.com/Mars-Rover-Api-Workshop. Today's progress was getting some of the API mapping and classes figured out. The next portion of the course will be on the front end and getting the mars rover pictures to display.

I also spent an additional hour working on a group project that I am working on with a few girls from my coding bootcamp that we graduated a few months ago.  One of the girls fosters dogs and saw a need for an improvement to their website, so we are building a foster website using React, MongoDB, and Express/Node on the backend. I am taking on the responsibilities for the back-end of the website. Today, I was able to 
1. Modified the server.js file and set up an API route to the mongoDB to "get" the data so we will be able to display the adoptable animals on the website
2. Created seeds to be added to the API when the user uses the command line to run "npm run seed"
3. I verified that the seed was being inputted correctly using Postman. As you can see in the screenshot, it took me a few tries in my history to understand what was going on. But, I was very happy to successfully get the response I was looking for!

**Thoughts:** I am excited to get a better handle on Java by doing a tutorial before diving into a personal project using Java. I am also excited to be working on the backend of this collab project with Ashley and Haylee. I definitely have found that I gravitate towards the backend development. It has been a while since I've worked on a group project and it is refreshing since that is one of the things I missed most about my coding bootcamp that I graduated back in March, 2020.  As far as this project, I am more familiar with MySQL, so using MongoDB is a good challenge for me.

### Day 2: July 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent around 3 hours working on my React Portfolio. I had a lot of CSS tweaking to do and changed around some content.

I was also very happy I was able to get my github pages to be hosted on a domain I purchased, www.blissfullycoding.com.

**Thoughts:** I thought the actual hosting onto my domain went a lot smoother than I was anticipating. I was happy that github and the website I used, NameCheap, were able to link up. I had to go through the Advanced DNS settings and add a few records (ports?) as well as a CNAME record linking to my GitHub. I am happy with my porfolio, but I wish I had more of a design background to make it more slick.  While I do enjoy monkeying with the CSS, I still do thrive more in the back-end side of web development at the moment. But, I would love to be able to become more familiar with website design and how to play with space and colors.

### Day 3: July 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued on my progress on the Mars API Workshop. I was able to follow along with Trevor Page and was successfully able to get the pictures from the REAL mars rover show up on localhost!

**Thoughts:** It was really exciting to get the response from the API and to actually be able to see the images. There are a LOT of new technologies in this course for me (Java, Thymeleaf, Springboot Framework), but I am following along well. I thought it was really cool how the Thymeleaf was able to loop through the API in the HTML code very easily to be able to display all the pictures from the API response. I am excited to continue to manipulate the response and front-end of the application to create something cool.  I believe that personal projects are the best way to learn, but it is also helpful for me to see how other people would tackle a problem and go about programming an application. Maybe I will do something space-y as a personal project after I am finished with this workshop.
